<h1>The Lasting Signifance that the 1990s and Nirvana are Having Today </h1>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<h4>
Nirvana was a grunge style rock band that produced music from the late 80’s into the mid 90’s which concluded due to the tragic death of Kurt Cobain 28 years ago.  The band consisted of front man, Kurt Cobain, bassist, Krist Novoselic, and drummer, Dave Growl.  With the anniversary of Kurt Cobain’s death, fans reflect on the impact that Nirvana has on not only the music industry, but even in the modern age.

<h2>
Nirvana and the music industry
</h2>
<h4>
Nirvana was monumental in the music industry because of how they never conformed to what was mainstream. They shaped the grunge rock industry by producing content that was relatable to teenagers/ young adults at the time. They never over charged for their concert tickets, and even called out other bands that were doing it. Nirvana also would be very vocal about not wanted to perform certain songs because of how overplayed they were on the radio, which caused issues between them and MTV. Nirvana was able to shape the industry because they wouldn’t bend to fit the standards of the music companies, and that was something that made them respectable to fans and music lovers alike.
</h4>
<h2>
Nirvana and Social Issues
</h2>
<h4>
Nirvana was ahead of their times by addressing social issues not only through their music, but also in interviews. Homophobia, racism, and sexism were brought up by the band and considering that it was the 90’s it was a big deal to speak out about social issues such as that. Kurt Cobain had challenged gender norms by wearing dresses while performing and during an interview as a way to challenge toxic masculinity that was especially prominent in the 80’s and 90’s. Nirvana was able to open up the door to conversations of social issues as a result of their activism.
</h4>
<h2>
The death of grunge and the rise of pop
</h2>
<h4>
After Kurt Cobain’s death, Nirvana dissolved along with the genre of grunge rock music. Grunge became less popular and with that a new genre of pop music began to rise in the industry. A new music group known as the Spice Girls formed in 1994, and after they became a hit there was a turning point in the genre’s popularity. Britney Spears was also a new face in music after her years of being a child actor, she started producing pop music in the late 90’s.

<h2>
Nirvana’s Impact on Modern Media Today
</h2>
<h4>
Ironically, Nirvana ended up becoming more popular than the band would have believed, even after they disbanded in 1994. The band has stated before how they never expected to get as big as they did, and this is shown with how popular songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) are still relevant today. Even now, more of their lesser-known songs have become popular with movies such as The Batman (2022) using Something In the Way (1991) throughout the film. Movies such as Black Widow (2021) and Captain Marvel (2019) have also used some of Nirvana’s most popular songs as well.

Nirvana has stayed relevant throughout the years because of how impactful their music was to the music industry, even in the modern age. They also have had a big cultural impact in America as a result of their music and advocacy on social issues. Music enthusiasts everywhere can agree that the legacy of Nirvana will never go away.
